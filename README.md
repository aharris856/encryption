# encryption
fun encryption program i made. You can use the encryptor class file and run it from something you write if you want,
the run Encrypt is just a GUI file that uses the Encryptor file. If you run the runEncrypt it should create a gui
that lets you chooes to enctrypt text, encrypt a file, or do an even harder encrypt on a file! i just made it for
fun so enjoy or tinker with it however you want on your own version :D
I also provided a few text files you can test it on.

small.txt - 100 lines
large.txt - 172822 lines
super.txt - 1728220 lines
